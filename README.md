# Stone Paper Scissors Game (C++)

A simple console-based Stone Paper Scissors game implemented in C++.

## About the Project
This project is a small console game where the player plays against the computer.
The player chooses Stone, Paper, or Scissors, while the computer generates a random choice.
Each round has a clear winner, and after finishing all rounds, the final game results are displayed.

The project was created as part of practicing C++ fundamentals and applying clean code principles.

## Game Features
- Player vs Computer gameplay
- Random computer choice generation
- Multiple rounds (from 1 to 10)
- Clear round-by-round results
- Final game summary
- Console color changes based on the winner
- Option to replay the game

## Project Structure
The project is intentionally kept simple and clean.

## What I Learned
While working on this project, I practiced and learned:
- Using functions to organize code and separate responsibilities
- Applying clean code concepts to make the logic clearer and easier to read
- Working with enums to represent choices and game results
- Using structs to store round and game information
- Generating random values for computer decisions
- Handling user input and validating it properly
- Managing game flow across multiple rounds

## Notes
This project focuses on logic, structure, and readability rather than advanced features.
It was written as a practice project while learning C++ and problem solving.
